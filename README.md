# Focussed Web Crawler

where focus is to extract information of Indian academicians working abroad.


## Description
The URL ordering based focussed web crawler does this on the basis of relevance of topic of interest of the user, the web pages are sorted using a priority queue before actually downloading them so as to search in a guided way using best first technique, rather than depth first technique of downloading all the web pages till a certain depth without calculating their relevance to out topic of interest usually leading to waste of resources, time and inefficient results thus justifying our choice for “url ordering based” focussed web crawler.
